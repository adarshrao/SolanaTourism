    Automated Market Makers form core DeFi infrastructure. They are sources of
    liquidity available 24 x 7, which are necessary for any healthy market and
    they act as reliable intermediaries between buyers and sellers. In a world
    without such pools, if you wanted to sell your SOL for USDC. You would have
    had to wait until someone was ready to purchase the exact amount off you.
    But by then, the price might have moved. Instead with the availability of
    such pools, you can instantly sell your SOL to it at the current price and
    get USDC right away.
