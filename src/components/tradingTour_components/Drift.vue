    Perpetual Futures Markets (PERPS) allow traders to place bets on prices of
    underlying tokens without the tokens themselves exchanging hands. They’re
    increasingly becoming popular because they reduce friction in the trading
    process.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you make a purchase (or a sale) on a PERP market, you are purchasing a
    contract that stipulates the amount of the token and the price at which
    you’ve made the purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s say the price of SOL is $20 today and you believe its price will go
    up.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-decimal ml-4 mb-4">
    <li>
      You can BUY 1 PERP contract for $20 and tomorrow when its price is $25,
      you can sell it back to pocket the profit of $5.
    </li>
    <li>
      Vice versa, if you believe the price will go down, you can sell a contract
      for $20 today and buy it at a lower price at a later date, pocketing the
      profit.
    </li>
  </ul>
