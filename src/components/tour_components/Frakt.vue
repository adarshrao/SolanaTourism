    While you were shopping on MagicEden, you might have noticed some expensive
    NFTs worth &gt;50 Sol. For example, Solana Monkey Business or ABC.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose you owned one of these NFTs but needed 10$ temporarily to pay for
    your Netflix.
  </p>
  <p>Frakt is your friend.</p>
  <p class="text-lg font-bold text-white">
    Frakt lets users mortgage their NFT and borrow SOL against them.
  </p>
  <p>Some common questions</p>
  <ol class="list-disc ml-4">
    <li>
      <span class="font-semibold text-white">
        Who provides this Sol for the loan?
      </span>
      — Other users like yourself. Some of these NFT collections are fairly
      popular and desirable and there are people who trust that the value of the
      NFTs will retain some value.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-semibold text-white"> What is the risk? </span> If the
      NFT collection drops in value, Frakt will take possession of the NFT and
      auction it out at half-price. This is riskier as you can imagine which is
      why the lending rates are higher
    </li>
  </ol>
  <div class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-white">
    Things to do at Frakt • Deposit Sol to earn a higher interest
  </div>
  <p class="font-semibold text-white">Steps</p>
  <ol class="list-decimal ml-4">
    <li>Go to app.frakt.com</li>
    <li>Go to Lend</li>
    <li>Connect your Wallet → Select Phantom</li>
    <li>Select an NFT Collection and click Deposit</li>
    <li>Choose Amount → Deposit</li>
    <li>Accept Transaction</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Take a moment to compare the deposit rate on Solend for Sol with the deposit
    rate on Frakt.
  </p>
  <p>Solend — 5%</p>
  <p>Frakt — 20%</p>
  <p>
    You might wonder — What if you deposit USDC on Solend, borrow Sol against it
    and then lend this Sol out on Frakt?

    Congratulations, you’re now thinking like a degen (it’s a fond word we use
    around here).
