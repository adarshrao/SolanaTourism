    You don’t have to go through it alone. Solana is home to many tribes that
    make it a more welcoming place. Browse through a few at this stop and join
    the ones that interest you!
  </p>

  <p>Here's my favorite one:</p>
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold" id="superteam">Superteam</h3>
  <p>
    Superteam is a community of people learning, earning and building in crypto.
    Among many other things they collect and offers bounties to contributors to
    work on projects on Solana. This project itself was funded via a grant from
    Superteam.
