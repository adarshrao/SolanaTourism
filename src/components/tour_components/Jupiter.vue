  <p class="">Did you fund your wallet or were you hesitant to do so?</p>

  <p>
    I actually don't have to ask. I can just search the Solana blockchain with
    your wallet address to see if you have funded it with money or not. Don't
    worry though, I only have view access. Blockchains are transparent and you
    can see just how many tokens every wallet contains.
  </p>

  <p>
    Websites that let you explore blockchains are called blockchain explorers
    and Solscan is one of them.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, just visit
    <a
      href="https://solscan.io/account/AhFjTUE2DgNFnAfRtFLUmLTLYyhxzz7j1cvKbvP18tg9"
    >
      this link
    </a>
    to find out how many tokens the wallet AhFj....8tg9 has

    Regardless, lets hit up the local Currency Exchange market and understand a
    little more about what other currencies exist on Solana.

    Jupiter is Solana’s premier Currency Exchange market. This is the place to
    visit whenever you want to swap currencies/tokens with one another.

    Tokens? Currencies? What?
  </div>
  <p>
    If you’ve following along, your wallet should only contain SOL till now.
    However, other currencies also exist on solana.
  </p>
  <div class="flex flex-col mb-6">
    For example, your wallet could also contain:

    <span>
      <span class="text-white font-semibold"> USDC, USDT </span> — Stablecoins
      pegged to the value of the US Dollar</span
    >

    <span>
      <span class="text-white font-semibold"> MNDE, LFNTY, ORCA </span>— Tokens
      belonging to teams and projects on Solana
    </span>

    <span
      ><span class="text-white font-semibold"> mSOL, SOL </span> — Staked
      version of Sol (will explain this later on)</span
    >

    <span>
      <span class="text-white font-semibold"> Bonk </span>— Meme tokens</span
    >
  </div>

  <p>
    Jupiter lets you swap your SOL for any of these tokens, or any of these
    tokens for SOL. It does so by aggregating all of the underlying markets
    across Solana to give you the best price for any of these assets.

    Things to do here — Swap SOL for some USDC
  </div>
  <p>
    Go ahead, exchange some of your SOL for USDC. You can do as small as a trade
    that it will let you do.
