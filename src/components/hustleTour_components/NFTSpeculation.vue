    Solana has a thriving NFT Community and is second in sales only to Ethereum.
    There are 100s of popular NFT Projects and many newer ones are launching
    every day. With this hype, comes opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lets look at some of the ways in which Solanians make (or lose) money on
    NFTs.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-xl mt-8" id="mint-and-flip">Mint and Flip</h3>
  <p>
    When NFT projects launch, they have a minting period where people can buy
    their NFTs at a base price. Once all the NFTs are sold the collection begins
    trading on the open market.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are people who mint highly popular NFT collections and then
    immediately flip them after launch. In order to mint in this period, your
    Solana wallet needs to be whitelisted. The whitelist criteria for projects
    differs but usually it has to do with performing actions beneficial to the
    community such as — being helpful in their discord, retweeting their twitter
    posts and just generally generating hype.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are people who discover the hottest new NFT collections yet to be
    launched, figure out a way to get whitelisted for their mint phase and after
    minting, flip the NFT for a profit.

    Disclaimer here that applies more broadly, NFT collections can and do go to
    zero. You can lose your entire money in anything in crypto and exercise
    restraint.

    Market-making NFTs is buying and selling NFTs in a tight range so that you
