    Yield Farming
  </h2>
  <p>
    NFT Speculation is an active endeavor. Some Solana citizens like to lay back
    and print money. They are known as Yield farmers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yield farming is a colorful term to describe earning interest on assets.
  </p>
  <h3 id="stake">Stake</h3>
  <p>
    You can stake SOL on a Solana Validator and earn interest for helping keep
    Solana secure. I go into more detail on this in the Validator’s section in
    the first-timer’s guide. This is generally considered ultra safe.
  </p>
  <h3 id="lending">Lending</h3>
  <p>
    There are lending protocols on Solana to whom you can lend USDC for
    interest, just like depositing it in a bank. Except you get paid the
    interest every second.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solend and MrgnFi are examples of two lending protocols that allow you to
    deposit USDC in return for an interest. Where they do make money from? Other
    people that borrow from them.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can alternatively also lend SOL to pools on Frakt which allows users to
    mortgage NFTs and borrow against them. You get a slightly higher lending
    rate from doing this but the risk is accordingly higher.
  </p>
  <h3 id="yield-share-nfts">Yield-share NFTs</h3>
  <p>
    Certain NFT Collections periodically distribute generate revenue to holders
    of their NFT collection. DegenFactCats is one such NFT collection which
    distributes the profits from its gambling website,
    <a href="http://degencoinflip.com">degencoinflip.com</a>
  </p>
  <h3 id="yield-share-tokens">Yield-share Tokens</h3>
  <p>
    Some protocols have tokens which grant you access to protocol revenue for
    holding them. For example: Locking LFNTY from Lifinity Protocol grants you
    access to protocol revenue that the Lifinity DEX generates.
