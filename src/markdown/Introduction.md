If Solana were a city, what attractions should a first-timer visit? What should they experience to really understand what it is like to be resident here.

Well, I’ve lived on Solana for the past year and this is my guide for a great first-time.

To access the internet, you use a web browser

To access the Solana blockchain, you will need a Solana wallet

And that is our first stop.

## **Stop 1 • Phantom**

Phantom enables you to create a Solana wallet that you will necessarily need as we make our way through the day’s itinerary. They are free to create.

### What is a Solana wallet?

The Solana wallet is your access pass to the blockchain. To connect to any app on Solana and take an action, you will need your wallet.

A wallet consists of two parts — A Public key and a Private key. You will need both.

- **Public Key**
    - These are 53 characters long and contain a mix of letters and numbers
        - AdARShQzEsTyUVaUoBtumGfJzPFHq1JLi3WrrHH42jCU
        - rao16KsxiPQD7p12zmpX3UcE1Ua19dGjcBndXk3MhKv
    - Think of this as your username. You can share this with other people.
    - Fun fact — Wallet Addresses don’t contain letters that can be mistaken for each other, for example. You won’t find zero-0 or Capital-O , small-l and capital-l across Solana wallets
- **Private Key**
    - A 12 letter mnemonic
        - Blunt Wrist Spicy Glaze Hiker Plume Lusty Caper Grasp Prawn Flume Tonic
    - Think of this as your password
    - **NEVER enter your private key anywhere other than the Phantom Wallet!** You’re in a foreign country and you’re an easy target. Stay safe!
